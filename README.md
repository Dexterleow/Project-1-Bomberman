### The approach taken:

The main framework of the game was designed on three grids (Arrays) to display the interaction of the character and his environment. After the arrays are created, it's a series of "if" & "else" to guide the program on which are the "logical" moves for the character and monsters to take.

In addition, arrays were also used as an important foundation to set-up the tiling of the map and render processes.

Unsolved problems, etc:

The game is functional and CSS & Sounds have also been added to enhance the gameplay.

Future development will be to customize the framework to a object-oriented framework to enable effective and rapid scaling of the game.

With object-oriented design, it will be much easier to add in new character, monsters, maps and multiplayers options.

Finally, instead of manually setting up the map (game stage), maps' counters and their variables ought to be randomize to efficiently create more levels for the game.
